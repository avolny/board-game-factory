# Board Game Factory

README IS IN PROGRESS

This is a vector-graphics framework intended for creating
and scaling up production of reusable assets with vector graphics.

I've developed it personally to satisfy my need for a solid prototyping
engine for board games, but inherently, it is in no way tied to making board games,
even though it contains a couple convenience classes for that (such as CardSheet for 
producing printable card sheets out of lists of components).

## Features

 - Component Tree structure - similar to making GUIs in Java.
 - Many basic components implemented:
   - Shapes:
     - Rectangle

## Usage

For examples of usage see tests.

## Things I made with BGF

Samples of prototypes I've made with this framework:
